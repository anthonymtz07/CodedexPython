"""
Welcome!
The programming language are we are learning is called Python, created by a developer named Guido van Rossum in the early 90s
Python is designed to be easy for us to read, which makes it the perfect coding language for benners. 
It's also super versatile and used in the following: 
    * Data analysis & visualization
    * Artificial intelligence (AI)
    * Web development
    * Machine learning (ML)
    * And more!

    All the code we write in this course will be in Python files, with the .py extensi√≥n. 
    Ah, one more thing! We know you are excited to start, but we need to equip you with code editor before you can write first line of code. 
    
    INSTRUCTIONS
    Copy this code: 
    name = input("Write your name: ")
    print(f"Hello {name}, are you ready?")

    This should appear in the Terminal window if you did it correctly
    Hello "name", are you ready? 
"""
name = input('Write your name: ')
print(f"Hello {name}, are you ready?")
