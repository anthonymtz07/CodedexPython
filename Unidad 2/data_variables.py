"""In programming, variables are used for storing data values. Each variable has a name and they hold a value. 
The variables name can consist of letters, numbers, an the _ underscore character.
These are all valid variable names and values: 

name = 'Antonio Martinez'
user_id = 2020143001
progress = 0.75
exp = 60
verified = true

The = equals sign means assigment: 
    * We are assinging the strig value 'Antonio Martinez' to the variable name.
    * We are assinging the number value 2020143001 to the variable user_id.
    * We are assinging the number value 0.75 to the variable progress.
    * We are assinging the number value 60 to the variable exp.
    * We are assinging the truth value true to the variable verified.

We can also change the value of a variable, or print it out: 
xp = 70 
xp = 80
print(xp) #output: 80

Here, we ara assigning the number value 70 to the variable xp. Then, we are reassigning to integer value 80 to the same variable. And printing it out. 

Data types
INTEGER
An integer, or int, is a whole number. It has no decimal point and contains the number 0, positive and negative counting numbers. If we were counting the 
number of people on the bus or the number of jellybeans in a jar, we would use an integer. 

year = 2023
age = 32

FLOAT
A floating-point number or a float, is a decimal number. It can be used to represent fractions or precise measeurements. If you were measuring the lenght 
and width of the couch, calculating the test score percentage, or storing a baseball player's batting average, we would use a float instead of an int.

pi = 3.14159
meal_cost = 12.99

STRING
A string or str, is used for storing text. Strings are wrapped in double quotes " " or single quotes ' '.
message = "good nine"
user = "@sonnynommon"

BOOLEAN
A Boolean data type, or bool, stores a value that can only be either true or false. In Python, it's capitalized True or False. 
It's named after the British mathematician George Boole

late_to_class = False
crackly = true.
